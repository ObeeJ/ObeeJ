- I build tech that solve real world problems 

     + Software engineer who builds fast, reliable systems with a knack for backend engineering, DevOps, and a touch of cloud.


 - What I Do

     + Backend with GoLang, Typescript: I code with Gin, Fiber, Fasthttp, net/http, and Node.js (Fastify). I benchmark the hell out of them to pick what fits the use case—performance matters.  

     + DevOps: I automate deployments, manage infrastructure with Docker and Kubernetes (intermediate level), and set up CI/CD pipelines that don’t break.  

     + Cloud: I’m focused on Google Cloud Services (GCS)—it’s my sandbox for now.
  
     + Datastores: Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL—I’ve got them dialed in.


- Bonus Skills

     + I can build UI and frontend components using AI tools. Not my core strength, but I’m honest about it—unlike some devs who oversell. It just gets the job done 💯! 

    + With over 3 years in product design (UI/UX) and product management, I bring a user-first mindset to the table.

    + I also play with Python when I need to script something quick. 



- What I’m Exploring

    + Rust (Actix): Diving into scalable systems, microservices, and performance-critical ops. I’m hooked on its potential.  

    + Web3 (Substrate): Heard it’s a beast to learn, but the payoff looks worth it. Early days here.  



Always up for new tech—Backend,Frontend, DevOps, Product Design and Management or a bit of cloud engineering.
