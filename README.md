# 👨🏽‍💻 ObeeJ – Software Engineer | Cloud-Native Builder | DevOps

Hey, I'm **Obanijesu Ajayi (ObeeJ)** — a passionate software engineer building scalable systems and developer-first tools at the intersection of performance and reliability.

I specialize in backend engineering with **Go** and **Rust**, and I'm building **cloud-native applications** using modern infrastructure tooling and AWS services. I also dive deep into **DevOps**, **distributed systems**, and emerging technologies like **Web3** and **ML/AI**.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Building

I’m working on microservices-based platforms from scratch, leveraging:

- **Go & Rust** for performant services
- **Docker** & **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **AWS Cloud Development** (EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, SES)
- Custom **API gateways**, caching strategies, and observability setups
- **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and embedded DB systems when needed

All my projects follow CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions** and Linux-native development workflows.
